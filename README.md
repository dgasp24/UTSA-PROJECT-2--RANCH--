## Introduction
  This was a project within my CS 1083 class at UTSA during my Freshman year. (2025)
  I was tasked to create a program that could serve as an inventory system for a ranch.

## How to Use
  When you start the file you are prompted to first add how many barns you have with the max being 15.
  
  You are then presented with a Main Menu, where you could:

  - `Empty Barn`
    - This emptys the barn that you select
    
  - `Add/Remove Cattle`
    - This is where you could add or remove cattle from a barn if you wanted to.
      
    - The max amount of cattle was 50

  - `List Barns Occupancy`
    -  This prints all the barns that are occupied and tells how many cattles are in each one

  - `Add New Barns`
    - You could add more barns if you wanted to, up to the max of 15

  - `Report`
    - This reports which barn is under, over, or at capacity
   
  - `Exit`
    - You can type "5" when you want to exit the program
     
## Final Thoughts
  We hadn't learnt it yet but with this program you definitely could've optimized it but just adding some simple things:

  - You could also add an exception in case there was any time the array may have gone out of bounds, etc.
    
  - You could seperate them all by different class with one being the barn and another being the cattle.
